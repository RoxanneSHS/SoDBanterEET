style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>SoD uses the new (new does not mean improved) concept to display banters between your NPCs in string head texts instead of conventional dialogues. These pseudo-banters can be easily overlooked and they are not stopping the game like normal dialogues (often they appear in between battles or mixed with other information).<br>

Within the EET context, this approach separates SoD from the rest of the game where banters are done traditionally via dialogues. It disrupts the EET idea of a continuous game with continuous creatures and features.

This mod converts the major banters of the continuous NPCs during SoD into *old-style* dialogues that interrupt the game and require player interaction. About 80 longer conversations during SoD are thus restored and maybe recognised by players for the first time. Many of them deserve larger attention.
<br>
In addition, the mod contains revised triggers for the banter dialogues.

 <br>
 <br>

Installation guidance:

Install the mod after all other mods which add banters to the game, i.e. right before installing EET_end.
<br>
Best use https://github.com/EE-Mod-Setup/EE-Mod-Setup for installation.

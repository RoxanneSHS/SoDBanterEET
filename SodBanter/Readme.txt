SoD Banter Restoration

SoD uses the new (new does not mean improved) concept to display banters between your NPCs in stringhead texts instead of conventional dialogues. These pseudo-banters can be easily overlooked and they are not stopping the game like normal dialogues (often they appear in between battles or mixed with other information).

Within the EET context, this approach separates SoD from the rest of the game where banters are done traditionally via dialogues. It disrupts the EET idea of a continuos game with continuos creatures and features.

This mod converts the major banters of the continuous NPCs during SoD into *old-style* dialogues that interrupt the game and require player interaction. About 80 longer conversations during SoD are thus restored and maybe recognised by players for the first time. Many of them deserve larger attention.

I excluded banters that were labelled *insults* (files BDIns001 - 030), they really contain only NPCs calling each other names. I also excluded banters that are only between pure SoD characters and do not involve any of the continuos NPCs.

This mod is only available for EET - only this modification allows the definition of banter files for the SoD campaign.

Note to modders
To support this mod, the definition of banter files for SoD was required. These definitions are found in BDBanter.2da. NPCs that continue from the BG1 campaign keep their BG1 Banter file according to EET conventions, new NPCs get a file assigned. For mod NPCs, EET automatically uses the entries made for interdia.2da, so nothing is required from modders for SoD unless they decide to add a different file for this part of the game. A full list of banter files for SoD can be found here:
